This Python script is designed for real-time emotion detection using a webcam feed in Google Colab. It leverages the deepface library for emotion analysis, opencv for image processing, and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to audibly announce the detected emotion. The program captures images from the webcam, analyzes them to detect emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.), and speaks out the detected emotion. The output is displayed in the Colab notebook using cv2_imshow.
